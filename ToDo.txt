x Change from flexbox to grid (we don't need to have responsive growth and shirnk, car e more about positioning in 2D space.)
x Make fields draggable
- Create export feature
- Retain state on refresh
- Add additional form fields
- Add additional field options
- Change Cell Menu location to sidebar
- Add new field by dragging components from sidebar
- When selecting field, show field data in sidebar for editing
- Allow importing
- Design the JSON structure (Maybe instead of creating as JSON doc, can create a React component that can then just be imported)


{
    form: {
        step: {
            group: {
                fields: [
                    {
                        fieldType: 'input',
                        caption: '',
                        altText: '',
                        id: '',
                        class: '',
                        name: '',
                        value: '',
                        options: {
                            required: true,
                            defaultValue: '',
                            inputType: '',
                            minLength: '',
                            maxLength: '',
                            regex: '',
                            for: '',
                            selected: '',
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
